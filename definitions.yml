artificial intelligence:
  definition: "Systems that exhibit intelligent behaviour."
  synonyms: [AI]
mean squared error:
  definition: "The average squared loss per example. MSE is calculated by dividing the squared loss by \
  the number of examples. The values that TensorFlow Playground displays for Training loss and Test loss are MSE."
supervised learning:
  definition: "Learning from labeled data. This is the most common learning method."
unsupervised learning:
  definition: "Learning from unlabeled data."
reinforcement learning:
  definition: "Learning through reinforcement; punishment and reward. Inspired by behavioural psychology."
  synonyms: [RL]
neural network:
  definition: "A type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain. \
  They are designed around layers of neurons doing simple operations."
