machine learning:
  definition: "A class of algorithms that learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T \
  and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

artificial intelligence:
  definition: "Systems that exhibit intelligent behaviour."
  synonyms: [AI]
supervised learning:
  definition: "Learning from labeled data. This is the most common learning method."
unsupervised learning:
  definition: "Learning from unlabeled data."
reinforcement learning:
  definition: "Learning through reinforcement; punishment and reward. Inspired by behavioural psychology."
  synonyms: [RL]
neural network:
  definition: "A type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain. \
  They are designed around layers of neurons doing simple operations. Fitting a neural \
  network is a matter of finding a set of weights of the connections between the neurons \
  that result in a low error function."
  synonyms: [NN, ANN, Artificial Neural Network]

deep learning:
  definition: "Neural networks with more than 1 hidden layers."
  synonyms: [DL]
  link: https://kasperfred.com/tag/deep-learning
hidden layer: 
  definition: "A layer in a neural network that is neither the input layer, or the output layer."
loss function:
  definition: "The criteria on which a supervised model is evaluated. The goal is to minimize this."
  synonyms: [Error function]
gradient descent:
  definition: "The primary algorithm used to train neural networks.\
  It works by iteratively taking small steps towards a lower error value \
  using the gradient of the error function with respect to individual weights."
back propagation:
  definition: "The algorithm used to find the gradient of the loss function with respect \
  to the individual weights. It works by repeatedly applying the chain rule."
chain rule:
  definition: "A mathematical theorem that lets you find the gradient of composite functions. \
  It is defined as:<br><br>
  /$f(g(x))' = f'(g) \\cdot g'(x)/$"
gradient:
  definition: "A vector of the derivatives of all the inputs to a multivariate function.
  The gradient of a function at a given point will point towards the direction of steepest ascent."
derivative:
  definition: "The slope of a line at a given point."
stochastic gradient descent:
  definition: "The same as gradient descent, but where you update the weights before having gone \ 
  through all the training data. This is a very common technique."
positive prediction:
  definition: "Predicting that an event has occured."
negative prediction:
  definition: "Predicting that an event has not occured."
false positive prediction:
  definition: "Falsely believing that an event has occured."
true positive prediction:
  definition: "Correctly believing that an event has occured."
false negative prediction:
  definition: "Falsely believing that an event has not occured."
true negative prediction:
  definition: "Correctly believing that an event has not occured."
bias:
  definition: "Statistical bias is the systematical difference in a models hypothesis and \
  and the true distribution. In neural networks, bias can also refer to the bias unit \
  which always takes the value of 1, and functions as threshold for a neuron's activation.<br>
  In machine learning, having a high bias is a sign of underfitting."
variance:
  definition: "Statistical variance is a measure of how spread-out a dataset is. \ 
  It's formally defined as /$\\sigma^2/$.<br>
  In machine learning, having a high variance is a sign of overfitting."
standard deviation:
  definition: "A measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation \
  or dispersion of a set of data values."
  synonyms: ["/$\\sigma/$"]

f1 score:
  definition: "A single measurement that combines precision and recall.
  It is defined as:<br><br>
  /$F_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\text{precision}}+\\frac{1}{\\text{recall}}}/$

overfitting:
  definition: "When a model fits a data distribution too closely,
  and thus fails to generalize to new data.<br>
  Overfitting is measurable as having a high variance, 
  and a large difference in accuracy between the training and test set."
underfitting:
  definition: "When a model fits a data distribution too loosely,
  and thus fails to capture patterns in the data.<br>
  Underfitting is measurable as having a high bias."
feature engineering:
  definition: "Computing new features from existing features in a dataset."
binomial distribution:
  definition: "A common distribution of probabilities that follows a bell shaped curve.
  The disribution is often found in nature."
  synonyms: ["Normal Distribution", "Gaussian Distribution", " Laplace-Gauss Distribution"]
convolutional neural network:
  definition: "A type of neural network modelled after the visual cortex.
  It has been found especially powerful in image recognition tasks, 
  but also natural language problems."
  synonyms: ["CNN"]
classification:
  definition: "Predicting descrete values such as of which group an object is a member.
  An example might be predicting which species an animal belongs to."
regression:
  definition: "Predicting continous values such as where on a spectrum an object falls.
  An example might be predicting the price of a house."
